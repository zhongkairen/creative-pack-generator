# Creative pack generator
The Advertising Dashboard Campaign Page includes a censorship pipeline that examines uploaded media files (videos and images) to detect re-uploaded content. If any media files are identified as duplicates, they will be rejected. 
The creative pack generator can effortlessly create unique media to avoid hassles related to this content re-uploaded check.

## Installation
The tool depends on `ffmpeg` and `ImageMagick`.
```
 brew install imagemagick
 brew install ffmpeg
```
## How to run
The tool runs in Terminal on macOS.
Simply run `new-creative` and a new set of video and image files will be generated in the same folder.
When uploading the media files to creative packs, ensure the most recent files are selected.
